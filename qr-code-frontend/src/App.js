// PROBLEM OVERVIEW
// Create a Form which has one text input and a submit button. The user can enter any data they want in the text input and when
// the submit button is clicked their input needs to be passed as a query parameter called "rawData" to the qr-code-service GET /generateQRCodeDataUrl endpoint
// The GET request will return a base64 encoded PNG image of the generated QR Code. Use that encoded file response as the src on an image tag
// to display the QR Code on the page. Users should be able to submit multiple requests and the QR Code Image for each Request should be displayed
// on the page along with the data that was used to generate the QR Code
